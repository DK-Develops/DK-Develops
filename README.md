## Hi, I'm Darsh

I have experience in Information Technology and basic programming through school and hands-on projects. I plan on attending college for Electrical/Computer Engineering in the coming year.

- IT support and system basics
- Python (basic understanding)
- Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS)
- Windows and Linux familiarity

I use GitHub to keep track of projects and learning work.
